The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, if a program is using a base class, it should be able to use any derived class without knowing the difference. This principle helps ensure that subclasses enhance functionality without altering expected behavior.
